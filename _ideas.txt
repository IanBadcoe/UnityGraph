UnityGraph ideas:

- render output into 3D scene somewhat like (some) Unexplored levels with rooms separated by void + optional walls/ceilings
-- some slight 3D design in that things may pass over/under each other
- topological rewrite rules
-- different zones in level, e.g. "corridors" vs. "caves"
- various upgrades to templates
-- replace > 1 node?
-- "any number of these" optional
-- stuff related to topological approaches may also change them
- loops
- redesign level on fly
-- mechanic to update while the user is in it, either:
--- progress smoothly to new level, shrinking deleted things down to nothing, growing added things and relaxing all as we go
--- move by discrete phases to new arrangement: 1) remove deletes, 2) move existing, 3) add new
---- e.g. drop deletes into the void, move existing sideways, raise new stuff out of the void
- compound rooms (>1 circle clsoe together)
- non-circular rooms
-- just place inside circle
-- non-circular area in relaxation?
-- four circles in a compound room?
